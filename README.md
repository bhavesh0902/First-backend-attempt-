# First-backend-attempt-
This is my first attempt to backend development. It is a basic calculator which asks for your height and weight and calculates your BMI. It is made using NodeJS with ExpressJS as framework. 
To set up the project:-
* Download the project folder and cd into it.
* Open your terminal and there and enter the following commands
```
* npm install
* node calculator.js
```
* Open `localhost:3000` in your browser.
